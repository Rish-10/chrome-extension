# chrome-extension

This is an extension that allows you to save specific URLs or save the current tab you are on, perfect for those sessions where you keep diving into too many tabs and get lost. 

In two clicks, when you open a new page or before you close one, if you want to note the website down somewhere, now you can. When you want to revisit the pages, click the logo and click the link you want and you're back on it. 

The extension also stores the data locally on your computer, as you see in the code, so don't worry about turning off your computer or closing the window. The links will still be there!

In addition to the delete-all feature, I also added the option to cycle through the saved tabs and delete them individually. 

Feel free to download the code and try it out in Chrome. Unfortunately, it will not work in Safari or any other browsers for now. 

Let me know if you have any feedback. 

Enjoy!

P.S. To launch it, download the folder, open chrome and go to chrome://extensions/. Click "Load unpacked", and select the folder you just downloaded.
